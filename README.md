## CS50
>This was my final project for conclude the CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python.

>CS, python, CS50
## Features
I've used CSV file to importing to Python
its was necessary to show the data as a dashboard 

## Explaining the project and the database
My final project is a dashbord for properties in different size ,types and regains .

All information about properties and regains stored in csv file.

I used liberse such as  pandas (to deal with data ) and matplotlib (to plot_graph).

## functions 
There are  as below :
1- the  mainmenu()  which show menu of options to choose between and will return their choice in dashbord
2- the alldata() which show all the data from the csv file.
3- region_check () which show data for a specific region.
4- property_types() which show data for different property types within a specific region.
5- compare_overall_increase() which show data for overall increase of property value for each region.
6- get_region() which gives the user a list of all the regions and asks them to pick one.

## About CS50
CS50 is a openware course from Havard University and taught by David J. Malan and lovely staff (Brenda Anderson,Doug Lloyd,Glenn Holloway and Rongxin Liu)

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values ; variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.
CS50P, is entirely focused on programming with Python.

Thank you for all CS50.
